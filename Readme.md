# Rythia a.k.a Sound Space Plus
Is a game made by @krmeet and it natively support Windows, Linux, and Android.

But you know, they doesn't seem to offer an official version for macOS (.dmg), so what i'm gonna do is download the source code from their repository https://github.com/krmeet/sound-space-plus import it to godot engine (they use this for the game) and manually export it into (.dmg).

### It supports both Apple Silicon and Intel!!!!
